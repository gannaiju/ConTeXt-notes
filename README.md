Fourteen years after its predecessor was released, this tutorial is completely rewritten. Now it comprehensively introduces how to use ConTeXt (>= MkIV) to typeset Simplified Chinese documents, mainly including the installation of ConTeXt LMTX, how to use Chinese fonts, and how to typeset lists, references, illustrations, tables, and framed texts. Furthermore, it is described how to use the MetaPost language for drawing in ConTeXt. Finally, how to make slides and books is introduced.
